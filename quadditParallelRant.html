            <p class="spaced">ok, im REALLY fed up with this guys. just because you have more parrallel sides than me doesn't make you better, alright?</p>
            <p class="spaced">we all have the same number of sides and vertices, so really you can just shush. and another thing - who decided parallel sides were good, anyway?</p>
            <p class="spaced">literally they are just two sides that don't meet. that's nothing special. literally thats my entire social life.         in short, parrallel sides are overrated.</p>
